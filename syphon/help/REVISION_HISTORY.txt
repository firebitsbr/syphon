# ... syphon is a telnet capture utility.  it is specifically
#     designed to read a 'line at a time' from devices such as
#     barcode readers or scales, which will output a EOL terminated
#     string upon event occurance.  
---------------------------------------------------------------------
# ... syphon functions over ethernet, relying upon 'serial over eth'
#     devices, which are becoming more and more comon.  syphon 
#     will auto-reconnect at a specified interval if no data is
#     gathered, ensuring that you have reliability after events such
#     as device failure / power loss / etc.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
# ... syphon is based on blips.  that is to say that blips was a
#     proof of concept, proving that 'it could be done', but was
#     also very limited and had absolutely no fault recovery.
#     syphon seeks to perform all the functions of blips, but with
#     automated fault recovery and much greater speed / efficiency.

REVISION HISTORY...
---------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------

ENTRY	NAME		V		REV	NOTES
-----	----		-		---	-----

0	blips		0.0-0-a		n/a	none, just getting started

1	blips		0.0-1-a		n/a	restructured to export opc data
						to mod_openopc_2 daemon write
						service, cleaned up some errors
						and problems, successfully ran
						for a few hours, but telnet will
						blow itself up if there is a 
						connection loss.

2	syphon		0.1-0-a		n/a	ported to python, added 'timeout'
						interval for no-data-received and
						auto-reconnect, cleaned up export
						function to mod_openopc_2,
						passed 30 day run test, although
						this is still an 'alpha' build, it
						is stable.

3	syphon		0.1-1-a		n/a	the port is cleaned up to allow
						full cross platform compatability,
						and syphon runs as 'platform agnostic'.

4	syphon		0.1-1-b		1	added time echo to several system
						feedback strings.

5	syphon		0.1-1-c		2	removed requirement to hardcode 
						global options file.  syphon now
						auto-declares its directory structure
						based on OS type.

6	syphon		0.1-2		n/a	deprecated procname in favor of 
						setproctitle library

7	syphon		0.1-3		n/a	added integration with S.E.E.R. 
						CheckWeigher Model in the form of
						RUN_SEER_CHECKWEIGHERMODEL_V1, which
						is compatiable with version 1 (Eudamidas),
						and should be with future versions as well.
						added requirement (optional if using this
						feature) for MySQL-python.

8	syphon		0.1-4		n/a	enhancement of v 0.1-3, where a 'cheat' 
						is now permitted for unknown or variable
 						length terminal server data / input data.
						if you have a device that outputs a variable
						length string, but always ends with the same
						'YOURENDOFLINE' characters, then you can
						simply start where you like and end at some
						ridiculously high character number, like 1000
						or 99.  The string (or number) will auto-truncate.

9	syphon		0.1-4		a	added variable declaration to helper script in order
						to shorten up the quick-start command line length
						and also added requirement of nohup to properly
						fork into background and remain persistent. 
						added bit bucket dump to clean up the screen.

10	syphon		0.1-4		b	removed variable declaration from helper script, 
						was posing problems... but the 'long form' for
						forking works wonderfully.

11	syphon		0.1-5		n/a	cleaned up readme file.  eliminated all helpers,
						such that an AUTO_LAUNCH routine was added.

12	syphon		0.1-5		a	bugfix - parsing strings based upon stand and
						end character would return whole original string
						which was a variable naming error.  fixed.

13	syphon		0.1-6		n/a	added compatability with SEER_CHECKWEIGHERMODEL_V2
						which logs the operator (person in control) of 
						each production line (scale / checkweigher)

14	syphon		0.1-6		a	bugfix - mysql keepalive instruction was unsuccessful,
						or at least that is why we believe that after long
						periods of inactivity syphon will fail to resume
						data logging after activity starts up again (mysql
						socket timeout).  The syphon_fault_unk() function is
						deprecated by syphon_fault_recycle() function, which
						recycles both the telnet connection and the mysql db
						socket connection every 5 minutes during periods of
						inactivity.  It also handles faulted instructions by
						dumping and then re-establishing telnet and db comm.

15	syphon		0.1-7		n/a	added compatability with SEER_WARRIOR module when
						utilizing the LaBLS ('lactalis_bartender_labeling_system')
						proprietary plugin.  Routine called 'RUN_SEER_WARRIOR_
						EOR_ACQUIRE' and 'RUN_SEER_WARRIOR_EOR_EXECUTE'.
						Compatiable with WARRIOR v.2 and SEER v.1.43 (release).

16	syphon		0.1-7		a	bugfix for RUN_SEER_WARRIOR_EOR_EXECUTE and ACQUIRE 
						where the incoming barcodes were not being parsed
						properly due to a typo (end of line characters removed
						from the original input string rather than from the
						already manipulated one - so the whole chunk was
						being logged).

17	syphon		0.1-7		b	added routine RUN_MYSQL to log a value to a mysql db
						with datestamp and source id.  
						bugfix for a few of the parse instances, throughout
						all routines, where string data when attempting to
						parse would receive unwanted additional end of line
						characters (minor issue). 
						subsequent reconnect attempts on 3 second interval
						rather than former 60 second interval.

18	syphon		0.1-7		c	AUTO_LAUNCH now monitors child threads, and anything
						that faults / dies / or is killed is automatically
						restarted on a rolling 5 second verification routine.

19	syphon		0.1-7		d	SEER_WARRIOR EOR_EXECUTE will now log the times
						it executes an end of run instruction to a line in the
						APLUS ACTION log.

20	syphon		0.1-8		n/a	finally split the various preset types up a little
						better, and gave each a unique file extension/suffix.
						added routine RUN_MATCH to check for a known value,
						and then write some other known value to target.

21	syphon		0.1-8		a	added ability to search during MATCH routine, rather
						than require exact match.

22	syphon		0.1-8		b	bugfixes for 0.1-8a

23	syphon		0.1-8		c	added ability to pull value to compare (for RUN_MATCH)
						from database rather than having to be statically
						declared... and added rebroadcast capabilities to
						all subroutines.

24	syphon		0.1-9			cleaned up the way we handle "REQUIRE_NUMERICVALUE"
						variable, such that it forces value to FLOAT type
						and then utilizes it (if and only if) you specify
						variable as required - this does not affect SEER
						WARRIOR EOR INTEGRATION which uses INT style values.
						also - going to polish this up a little and declare
						it as 1.9, as the bulk o changes from 0.1-8c are
						a worthy of an increment.

25	syphon		0.1-9		a	bugfix (preventative) for event files where potentially 
						a file lock issue could occur if two events 
						(generate FLATFILE) occurred for the same item during
						the same second.

26	syphon		0.1-10		n/a	added mysql database logging for RUN_OPC and RUN_MATCH
						routines, so that one device connection can perform
						both OPC functionality and SQL Logging functionality.

27	syphon		0.1-11		n/a	bugfix for build #26, where RUN_MATCH considered both
						command line option #2 and #3 as the same thing.
						added conditional checks for routines RUN_OPC, RUN_MATCH,
						and RUN_MYSQL.  similar in nature to
						"RUN_CONDITIONAL_RETRANSMIT", where it checks DB for
						device conditional flag before proceeding with task.
