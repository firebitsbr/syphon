# what would you like the 'SOURCE' column to indicate in
# the database record for values read from this device
STARTCHAR:0
# parse the data stream, start at...
ENDCHAR:5
# then end at...
# NOTE - if you have a variable length incoming data, but
#        always know your line will end with YOURENDOFLINE,
#  	 then you can 'cheat' by setting ENDCHAR equal to
#        some very high or ridiculous number, like 1000
#        or 99
REQUIRENUMERICVALUE:yes
# do you want to require that only a
# numeric value can be processed?
# -- valid values are 'yes' or 'no'
YOURENDOFLINE:\r\n\r
# character or group of characters to
# indicate the end of an input stream
YOURTIMEOUT:300

#   OR ON YOUR OWN WITH YOUR OWN CUSTOM SCRIPT,
#   AS WE CAN'T CARRY THAT FUNCTION OUT FROM HERE.
#   FOR SEER+mod_openopc, JUST SET UP A 'preset' 
#   SIMILAR TO THE SYSTEM_FAULTS ONE AND ENTER 
#   YOUR RETENTION TIME.  WE ASSUME YOU HAVE A 
#   FULL WORKING KNOWLEDGE OF mod_openopc.

YOURDEVICECOLUMNNAME:mydevicecolumnname
# NAME OF COLUMN WITHIN "YOURDEVICETABLENAME" THAT IDENTIFIES RECORDS

YOURCONDITIONALVALUE:myconditionalvalue
# VALUE YOU WISH TO TEST AGAINST... IF WE SEE THIS VALUE IN NEXT COLUMN OF
